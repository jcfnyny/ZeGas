# ZeGas.md — Layer 2 Gas Optimization Module

## Executive Summary
**ZeGas** is a decentralized transaction scheduler and gas optimization protocol for Ethereum and compatible networks. It enables users, bots, and corporate treasuries to **automate transactions based on real-time gas price conditions**, ensuring cost-efficient and timely execution.

The newly introduced **Layer 2 Gas Optimization Module** extends ZeGas beyond Ethereum mainnet, allowing dynamic routing of scheduled transactions to **Optimistic and ZK rollups** (Arbitrum, Base, zkSync, etc.) or even specialized low-fee chains like **Hyperliquid Core**. This adaptive system intelligently decides the best execution layer to minimize costs, leveraging cross-chain bridges and paymaster-based gas abstraction for seamless user experience.

In simple terms: **ZeGas watches gas prices, compares networks, and executes when it’s cheapest — automatically.**

## Overview
**ZeGas** is an Ethereum transaction scheduler and gas-optimization protocol that enables users and dApps to execute transactions only when network conditions are optimal. The **Layer 2 Gas Optimization Module** extends ZeGas’ functionality by leveraging Ethereum rollups and specialized low-cost execution environments to minimize gas fees while preserving mainnet-level security.

---

## 1. Problem
Historically, Ethereum transaction fees (gas) were unpredictable and expensive ($30–60 during 2021). As network adoption grew, congestion led to gas wars, limiting usability for smaller accounts and automation use cases.

Even with EIP-1559, gas volatility persisted. However, the emergence of **Layer 2 (L2)** rollups (Optimistic and ZK-based) and specialized L1s (e.g., Hyperliquid Core) have dramatically reduced fees—down to **$0.06–$0.09 per swap**, while inheriting Ethereum’s security guarantees.

ZeGas now evolves from a simple L1 scheduler into a **cross-layer execution optimizer** that dynamically selects the cheapest and fastest execution venue.

---

## 2. Objectives
- Reduce transaction fees by automatically selecting the lowest-cost execution layer (L1 or L2).
- Allow conditional or time-based execution (e.g., send ETH when gas < 15 gwei or after 12h).
- Enable users to pay fees in stablecoins (USDC/DAI) via Paymaster abstraction.
- Provide an interface for both retail and institutional users (e.g., Zeb3 Treasury Bots).
- Maintain L1-level security and transparency across all executions.

## 3. Architecture

### Components
| Module | Role |
|--------|------|
| **ZeGas Orchestrator (L1 + Off-chain Indexer)** | Monitors gas prices and L2 sequencer fees; triggers execution. |
| **ZeGas Smart Scheduler Contract (L1)** | Stores user configuration (gas cap, expiry, destination). Communicates with L2 contracts via canonical bridges. |
| **ZeGas Relayer Network** | Executes transactions through optimal routes (L1, L2, or specialized chain). |
| **Fee Optimizer (Oracle/AI Layer)** | Compares fee rates across networks and provides real-time routing data. |
| **ZeGas dApp Dashboard** | User interface for scheduling, monitoring, and managing executions. |

### Execution Flow
1. User configures a transaction with parameters: destination, function, gas cap, expiry, and L2 preferences.
2. Orchestrator continuously monitors Ethereum and L2 networks.
3. When gas < threshold or a cheaper L2 path exists:
   - Execute on Ethereum if below gas cap.
   - Else bridge to L2 contract and execute there.
   - If both expensive, queue for next window until expiry.
4. Unused gas refunded automatically. Optional stablecoin-based gas payment.

### Simplified Logic
```js
if (L1_gas < user.threshold) {
   executeOn("ethereum");
} else {
   let bestL2 = compareFees(["base", "optimism", "arbitrum", "zkSync"]);
   if (bestL2.fee < L1_gas * 0.8) executeOn(bestL2.name);
   else waitUntilNextWindow();
}
```

## 4. Supported Networks
| Category | Examples | Avg Fee | Security |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **Ethereum L1** | Mainnet | $0.40–0.90 | Full Ethereum security |
| **Optimistic Rollups** | Arbitrum, Optimism, Base | $0.02–0.05 | Fraud-proof window |
| **ZK Rollups** | zkSync, Starknet, Linea | $0.01–0.03 | Validity proofs |
| **App Chains** | Hyperliquid Core, Scroll X | ≈ $0 | Fixed compute cost |

---

## 5. User Configuration Options
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Gas Cap** | Max gwei or USD equivalent. |
| **Preferred Layer 2s** | Choose auto or specific networks. |
| **Execution Deadline** | Define time window before auto-refund. |
| **Fee Token** | Pay gas in ETH or stablecoins. |
| **Aggregator Mode** | Batch multiple small txs into one L2 call. |
| **Fallback Rule** | Retry on L1 if L2 unavailable. |

---

## 6. Integration Examples
### Zeb3 Treasury Scenario
Zeb3 Labs can automate ETH/WBTC rebalancing across wallets only when:
- L1 gas < 10 gwei, or
- L2 fees < $0.05.

The ZeGas Orchestrator executes transfers automatically on the cheapest network. Remaining balances sweep back to L1 during off-peak hours, achieving 95% fee savings.

---

## 7. Smart-Contract Enhancements
- **Cross-Chain Messaging (CCIP, LayerZero, Axelar)** for atomic sync across networks.
- **EIP-4337 Paymaster Integration** to support gas payment in stablecoins.
- **Batch Bundling** to minimize per-tx gas.
- **Auto-Bridging Module** to manage collateral between L1/L2s.

---

## 8. Key Benefits
| Dimension | Old Model | L2-Aware ZeGas |
|------------|------------|----------------|
| Cost | $30–60 avg | <$0.10 avg |
| Speed | 30–60 s | <2 s |
| Security | L1 only | L1 + L2 inherited |
| UX | Manual gas mgmt | Automated routing |
| Scale | Thousands/day | Millions/day |

## 9. Success Metrics
- ≥95% reduction in average transaction cost.
- <2 s average confirmation time.
- ≥99% successful conditional executions.

---

## 10. Next Steps
1. Implement gas oracle aggregator (EIP-1559 + L2 fee data).
2. Deploy L2 scheduler contracts (Arbitrum, Base, zkSync).
3. Integrate Paymaster for stablecoin-based fee abstraction.
4. Release beta with dashboard and CLI tools.
